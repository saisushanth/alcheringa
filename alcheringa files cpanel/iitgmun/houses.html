			<h4 style="margin-top:-55px;">UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY DISEC</h4>
		<p align="justify" style="color:#b58f2c;">

The Disarmament and International Security Committee (DISEC), also known as the First Committee, is one of the six main committees of the General Assembly of the United Nations. The DISEC deals with disarmament, global challenges and threats to peace that affect the international community and seeks out solutions to the challenges in the international security regime. The first committee conducted its 67th session in 2012.
<br><br>
Since the birth of DISEC, the goals of multilateral disarmament and arms limitation have been deemed central to the maintenance of international peace and security.  In spite of the millions of casualties in the two world wars and succeeding conflicts, nations continue to jockey for the control and manufacture of even more weapons. About 22,000 nuclear warheads reportedly remain in our world today and there have been over 2,000 nuclear tests conducted to date. Aside from nuclear weapons, chemical and biological weapons also pose an ongoing threat, as demonstrated by recent attacks in Syria. There are numerous countries around the world that have offensive biological and chemical weapons programs. The risk of terrorist groups acquiring these types of weapons has increased tremendously. Disarmament is the best protection against such dangers, but achieving this goal has been a tremendously difficult challenge. The need for a culture of peace and for significant arms reduction worldwide has never been greater.<br><br>
However, DISEC has proved to be a broad and inclusive platform for resolving pressing issues concerning disarmament and international security. The first committee takes up matters concerning the maintenance of international peace in the light of the general principles of cooperation in amicable negotiations, in order to prevent the heightening of tensions in the international system and the commencement of an armed conflict. It has been the primary origin of legal initiatives that led to important international treaties and conventions, such as the Treaty of Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (1968), the Chemical Weapons Convention (1992) and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (1996).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

  </div>

				<p align="justify">Responsibility to protect is a principle that provides a framework for using tools to prevent mass 

atrocities. The authority to employ the last resort and intervene militarily rests solely with United 

Nations Security Council and the General Assembly.</p>


<p align="justify">The international community, through the United Nations, also has the responsibility to use appropriate 

diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful means, in accordance with Chapters VI and VIII of the 

Charter of the United Nations, to help protect populations from war crimes, genocides, ethnic cleansing 

and crimes against humanity. In this context, we are prepared to take collective action, in a timely and 

decisive manner, through the Security Council, in accordance with the Charter, including Chapter VII, 

on a case-by-case basis and in cooperation with relevant regional organizations as appropriate, should 

peaceful means be inadequate and national authorities manifestly fail to protect their populations from 

genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. We stress the need for the General 

Assembly to continue consideration of the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war 

crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity and its implications, bearing in mind the principles 

of the Charter and international law.
</p>

<p align="justify">The “responsibility to protect” principle imparts the international community with three commitments: 

the responsibility to prevent; the responsibility to react; and the responsibility to rebuild. This idea 

thus provides a new way of conceptualizing sovereignty in order to move to a culture of national and 

international accountability.</p>
