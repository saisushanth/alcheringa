      <p class="style1_text">On the stage are the people you have only seen on TV before. They are big. They are the superstars. They are the Kings of Pop. And they are here just for you. And this is easily the most electrifying nite in Alcher.</p>
      <p class="style1_text"> This will be the night where you&rsquo;ll feel the entire world into one concert ground. Crowds in excess of 15,000. The very atmosphere is enough to set your heart racing. But wait, the music hasn&rsquo;t started yet&hellip; just wait for that to hypnotize your mind and your arms and your legs.<br />

        Think we are kidding?<strong> Strings, Euphoria, KK, Remo, Indian Ocean</strong> and many more say otherwise&hellip;<br />
