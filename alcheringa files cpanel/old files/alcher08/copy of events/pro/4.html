      <p class="style1_text">Indian Classical Music is perhaps the most complete and complex musical system ever developed and in Alcheringa we showcase the true Masters. In the past, we have been host to greats like double Grammy award winner Pt. Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, German Band Mito, Pt. Bhajan Sapori and the likes. <br />
        They are the ones who have understood Music and transcended it.</p>
