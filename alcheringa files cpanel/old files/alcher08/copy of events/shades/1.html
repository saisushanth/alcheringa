	  <p class="style1_text">What we can do in Art, we can do nowhere else. In art, we get to express our inner-most inspirations; which is what Alcheringa stands for. Alcheringa stands for the Eternal Dreamtime, a kind of principle by the artist is inspired to create a masterpiece, a force with connects Reality and the Dreaming.</p>
	  <p class="style1_text">For Art, Shades is the place to be. You are given an extraordinary degree of freedom to express yourselves. You can wear it on fabric, wear it on yourselves, you can let everyone see it by painting on the street; express an idea through a thousand pictures in the collage, that&rsquo;s more words than you can count; you can be the rebel by letting your hair do the talking. Or maybe you don&rsquo;t want to restricted by anything, then Crazy Canvas is your cup of tea: no paints, just your imagination and everything else around you.<br />
