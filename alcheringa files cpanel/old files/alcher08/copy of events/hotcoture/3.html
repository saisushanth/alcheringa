	  <p class="style1_text">College wear<br />
	    Do you feel the best part of your college life is getting dressed up for it? If you do then this event will be a piece of cake. <br />
	    College wear is the preliminary round for Hot Couture and the dress code emphasizes comfort and personal expression over presentation and uniformity, so just gear up, get trendy and get comfy.</p>
	  <h2 class="style1_text">FINALS:</H2>
      <p class="style1_text">Wacky <br />
&lsquo;Crazy&rsquo; is the word for it - Define your own fashion statement!<br />
      Imagination is the soul of all fashion. So this round is all about creativity, originality and a chance to make a style statement with your brand of fashion. So just put on your thinking caps and stretch your limits of innovation as there are no boundaries in this round. <br />
      Think out-of-the-box and go CrAzY!!</p>
      <p class="style1_text">Traditional<br />
  The word tradition comes from the Latin word &ldquo;traditio&rdquo; which means to hand over. So if you thought traditional was boring, then widen your horizons and think again. <br />
  The sheer number of cultures all over the world does make a rich and vibrant fashion. So think all the possibilities, be it the classic Indian or the west, recreate the culture on stage and set it on fire.</p>
	  <p class="style1_text">Retro<br />
&ldquo;Revel in Retro&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s the essence of Alcheringa 2008 and hence we are recreating the atmosphere of that classic era, the 60&rsquo;s 70&rsquo;s &amp; 80&rsquo;s. If watching old Hindi movies or listening to Pink Floyd makes you nostalgic, then c&rsquo;mon this is the ramp where you&rsquo;ll get to be the next Elvis Presley &amp; Marilyn Monroe!!<br />
